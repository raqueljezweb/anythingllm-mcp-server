```

## Configuration

### For TypingMind.com

#### Setup Instructions

1. Go to [TypingMind.com](https://www.typingmind.com/)
2. Click on **Settings** ‚Üí **MCP Servers**
3. In the MCP configuration editor, add the AnythingLLM server:

   ```json
   {
    "mcpServers": {
      "anythingllm": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "anythingllm-mcp-server@1.0.3"]
      }
    }
  }
   ```

4. Click **Save** - TypingMind will restart the MCP servers
5. Look for the "Connected" status

#### First Time Usage

After the server connects, initialize it with your AnythingLLM credentials:

1. In the chat, type:
   ```
   Use the initialize_anythingllm tool with apiKey: "your-api-key" and baseUrl: "http://localhost:3001"
   ```

2. Replace:
   - `"your-api-key"` with your AnythingLLM API key (get it from AnythingLLM ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys)
   - `"http://localhost:3001"` with your AnythingLLM instance URL

3. You'll see: "AnythingLLM client initialized successfully"

#### Example Commands

After initialization, use natural language to interact with AnythingLLM:

- "List all my workspaces"
- "Create a new workspace called 'Project Documentation'"
- "Chat with the 'research' workspace about the latest findings"
- "Show me all documents in the 'knowledge-base' workspace"

TypingMind will automatically use the appropriate AnythingLLM tools.

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**On macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**On Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anythingllm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "anythingllm-mcp-server@1.0.3"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Initialization

When first using the server in your MCP client, you'll need to initialize it with your AnythingLLM credentials by calling the `initialize_anythingllm` tool:

```
Use the initialize_anythingllm tool with apiKey: "your-api-key" and baseUrl: "http://localhost:3001"
```

- **apiKey**: Get this from your AnythingLLM instance at `/settings/api-keys`
- **baseUrl**: Your AnythingLLM instance URL (default: `http://localhost:3001`)

You can also set these as environment variables:
- `ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY`: Your API key

## API Reference

This MCP server connects to the following AnythingLLM API endpoints:

- `/api/v1/workspaces` - Workspace operations
- `/api/v1/workspace/{slug}/chat` - Chat functionality
- `/api/v1/workspace/{slug}/documents` - Document management
- `/api/v1/system/settings` - System configuration

For complete API documentation, visit `/api/docs` on your AnythingLLM instance.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- ‚úÖ Ensure your AnythingLLM instance is running and accessible
- ‚úÖ Verify the API key has proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Check that the base URL is correct (include http/https)
- ‚úÖ Make sure the AnythingLLM API is enabled in your instance

### API Errors
- Most errors will include descriptive messages
- Check AnythingLLM logs for detailed error information
- Ensure your API key hasn't expired
- Verify workspace slugs are correct when accessing specific workspaces

### Common Issues

**"Client not initialized" error:**
- Make sure you've initialized the server with your API key and base URL

**"Workspace not found" error:**
- Check that the workspace slug is correct
- Use `list_workspaces` to see available workspaces

**Connection refused:**
- Verify AnythingLLM is running on the specified port
- Check firewall settings

## Security Notes

- üîê Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control
- üîí Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in production
- üõ°Ô∏è Restrict API key permissions to only what's needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your API key publicly
